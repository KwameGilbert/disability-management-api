# Disability Management System - Workflow & Interface Design
Based on the API documentation, I'll outline the necessary pages, interfaces, and API endpoints for building a comprehensive disability management system. This document follows the workflow from PWD registration to assistance fulfillment.

- `GET /v1/pwd-records` (with status filters) - For pending/approved PWD counts
- `GET /v1/assistance-requests` (with status filters) - For pending/assessed assistance requests

### Key Components:
- Summary metrics (total PWDs, pending approvals, etc.)
- Charts showing PWD registration trends by quarter/year
- Charts showing assistance requests by type and status

7. Complete Workflow Sequence
PWD Registration & Approval Workflow:
## 7. Complete Workflow Sequence
### PWD Registration & Approval Workflow:
#### Registration:
1. Officer registers a new PWD using the Add PWD form
2. System creates PWD record with "pending" status
3. PWD appears in pending approvals list

#### Review & Approval:
1. Admin reviews pending PWDs from dashboard or PWD list
2. Admin views PWD details and supporting documents
3. Admin approves or declines the PWD registration
4. System updates PWD status and records the action

### Assistance Request Workflow:
#### Request Creation:
1. PWD visits office seeking assistance
2. Officer creates new assistance request for the PWD
3. System records request with "pending" status

#### Review:
1. Admin reviews pending requests
2. Admin updates status to "review" or declines
3. Admin adds notes if needed

#### Ready for Assessment:
1. Admin marks request as "ready_to_access"
2. This indicates the request has been approved for fulfillment

#### Assessment:
1. PWD receives assistance
2. Officer marks request as "assessed"
3. Officer adds notes about what was provided

#### Repeat:
1. PWD can return later for additional assistance
2. New request goes through the same workflow
